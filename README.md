# hashtables-introduction
A small project which shows how Hash tables work, and different types of element insertion ("hashing")

This project shows how four different types of Hashing may work:
Chaining, Linear and Quadratic Probing, and Double Hashing
and possible Problems with the latter two.

The Array of input elements to be put into a Hash table (A), and the Hash table size (T_len), need to be defined by altering the corresponding variable values in the first lines of the project
